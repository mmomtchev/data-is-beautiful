# r/dataisbeautiful

This is a (future) collection of my posts in r/dataisbeautiful

It is meant both as a tutorial for creating visualizations in JavaScript (and TypeScript) and as a demo for two of my major npm packages:

* [node-ffmpeg](https://github.com/mmomtchev/node-ffmpeg) - a complete integration of the ffmpeg audio and video streaming framework with Node.js using `nobind17` (of which I am the author)
* [magickwand.js](https://github.com/mmomtchev/magickwand.js) - Full ImageMagick-7 bindings for Node.js - meant both as a full-featured general-purpose image processing library for Node.js and browser JavaScript and as testing grounds for SWIG Node-API (of which I am the author), includes a tutorial for porting C++ libraries to Node.js

They are very-well suited for scientific visualizations and offer a rare high-level language alternative to the currently existing Python-based tools.

Both of these libraries do all the heavy lifting using fully multi-threaded high-performance C++/ASM SIMD code, while offering a very easy-to-use high-level JavaScript and TypeScript API.

Currently there is only one visualization:

* [Successful Orbital Launches per Year and per Country](https://github.com/mmomtchev/data-is-beautiful/tree/main/orbital-launches)
